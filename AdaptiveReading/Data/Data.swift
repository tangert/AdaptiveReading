Ramón y Cajal applied Golgi’s method to the embryonic nervous systems of many animals as well as humans. By examining the structure of neurons in almost every region of the nervous system, he could describe classes of nerve cells and map the precise connections between many of them. In this way Ramón y Cajal adduced two principles of neural organization that would prove particularly valuable in studying communication in the nervous system.

The first of these has come to be known as the principle of dynamic polarization. It states that electrical signals within a nerve cell flow only in one direction: from the receiving sites of the neuron, usually the dendrites and cell body, to the trigger region at the axon. From there the action potential is propagated along the entire length of the axon to its terminals. In most neurons studied to date electrical signals in fact travel in one direction.

The other principle advanced by Ramón y Cajal is that of connectional specificity, which states that nerve cells do not connect randomly with one another in the formation of networks. Rather each cell makes specific connections—at particular contact points—with certain postsynaptic target cells but not with others. The principles of dynamic polarization and connectional specificity are the basis of the modern connectionist approach to studying the brain.

Children affected with autism, a developmental disorder, have a higher frequency of seizures and cognitive problems than the general population, and some are severely disabled. However, many autistic individuals have normal or above-normal intelligence, and can go on to lead highly successful lives. The fact that autistic defects in social communication can coexist with normal intelligence in other domains suggests that the brain is modular, with distinct cognitive functions that can vary independently.

The idea that distinct genes affect different cognitive domains is supported by the contrasting effects of a rare genetic syndrome called Williams syndrome. Children with Williams syndrome acquire language late, but they ultimately overcome their early deficits to develop strong language skills and normal social behavior. In fact, these children exhibit extreme sociability. However, Williams children are profoundly defective in spatial processing, and they score as poorly as, or even worse than, autistic children on IQ tests.

The different patterns of impairments in autism and Williams syndrome suggest that language and social skills can be separated from some other brain functions. Brain areas concerned with language are impaired in autistic children, whereas general and spatial intelligence is more impaired in Williams syndrome. At least part of the explanation for this difference is that while Williams syndrome is caused by a single-site genetic mutation, autism is caused by a variety of different genetic changes.
